# QUALITY DASHBOARD
The purpose of creating this dashboard is to track the overall Quality Metrics of any product/service within any organization which has a lot of teams and so it's difficult to track each team manually.

### QA Dashboard can help to track:
1. Progress in terms of `Test Coverage` like how many total testcases we have, distribution in terms of priority like P0, P1, P2 etc, Automation coverage and many more

2. Progress report of `Automation Stability` and Execution time for each stream/project and other relevant trend charts around it

3. `Bugs Metrics` ie. data around total tickets tested, numbers of Bugs found in production or staging environment, what is their priority and other relevant trend charts around it

4. `Code Coverage` data is helpful to track the code coverage for developer's code via Unit Tests (written by devs). It supports not only Line Coverage but also Statement Coverage, Branch Coverage & Function Coverage (default is line coverage)
